      Time to shine and I'm down to ride 
      I'm gonna drive until the break of dawn, wilding out 
      I'm on a mission grinding out 
      whatever it is I gotta do
      Riding out until the day I meet you, I'm riding out 
      
      I look up in the sky (sky) 
      Asking lotta, why? (Why?) 
      But never let it phase me, I'm keeping good vibes 
      When I'm on the road, watch out for all surprises 
      What it provides us Good and bad but nothing unties us 
      
      Another wander in the night
      Let me paint the view 
      Color a town with my light 
      For every moment shared with you 
      Not out in the day 
      But never fully gone 
      Going to be back again
      Until the coming of a dawn 
      
      for all the days ahead of us put your hands up
      Wave 'em side to side for good luck, ah 
      (Hey) for all the nights like this, put your hands up 
      Love the moment even from dusk, yup 
      (Hey) you always got my back, and of course I got your back 
      Don't you worry about that now 
      (Hey) it's been a good day, good night 
      It's gonna be a good day, good night 
      
      Two hands meet at zenith 
      Nothing comes between us 
      Dancing like ballerinas 
      Under, the moonlight all night long 
      How these plain and simple scenes 
      Get painted so vividly by you 
      I just wanna stay with you 
      
      Around the world I slowly dance
      Whenever our eyes meet 
      You know you leave me in a trance 
      It means everything to me 
      Looking down below 
      The one I seek to find
      No matter where you might go 
      Remember you'll be on my mind 
      always watching over me somehow you make me feel invincible 
      Power to my soul, yup (Hey)
      I'm at ease with things that used to bother me 
      'Cause your existence just ights me up, yup 
      (Hey) you always got my back, and of course I got your back 
      Don't you worry about that now 
      (Hey) it's been a good day, good night
      It's gonna be a good day, good night 
      
      Within the inner heart I plead 
      For you to talk to me 
      I wanna hear all the good and bad 
      The new stories you have 
      As I drift across the sky 
      The hour hand turns high 
      So goodnight 
      Let me sing a lullaby, love 
      I'll be seeing you, baby
